The Exploartoray Data Analysis on food production and food supply in Africa

DATA STORYTELLING FOR FOOD PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY IN AFRICA.
The dataset used, related to food production for African Countries from the 2004 to 2013, and
also the food supply data for also African Countries from year 2004 to 2013.
The goal was to find trends, and answer certain questions in terms of production, shortages and
supplies for Food Production in the country.
And with that, there was no missing data or duplicated data found in both datasets. The first
thing was to explore the Food Production data.
Food Production:
It featured a number of 4 features, which are the:
1. Country
2. Year
3. Value
4. Item
Later another column was added to show that the Value of each item was measured in the Metric
of Kiloton.
The number are 54 countries, and the number of Food produced item is 247 items.
For the Value in Kiloton for all Items, for 54 countries from year 2004 to 2013:
a) The minimum value was 0kt
b) The maximum value was 54000kt
c) The mean value was 327.7kt
In checking for Outliers for Food Production per year we could see that this occurredThen the investigation of the trend For Countries per the Value of Food produced is shown
below
This figure above shows at which year, and which the country has the highest Metric Tons in
Food Production and we can see that the country with Nigeria produces more tons of food than
others.
For The Food Production Trend Per YearNigeria has the Highest Trend in food production.
For better view of the Trend, the best way to visualize it is in Bar Plot
With the Figure above it shows the Country which produces more food. Also shows the
progression of Food production, from year 2004 to year 2013.
The top 5 countries with the highest food production:
1. Nigeria
2. Egypt3. South Africa
4. United Republic
5. Ghana
We can see that the food product <b> Sugar Cane is more produced in South Africa. The country
Nigeria produces more Yam and Cassava produces than other countries in Africa, since 2004 to
2013.
List of Top Produce Food Items
a) Cassava and Products
b) Sugar Cane
c) Maize and Products
d) Yams
e) Vegetables, Other
The Top 5 Countries with the Number of Food Production are:
1. Nigeria
2. Egypt
3. South Africa
4. Ethiopia
5. United RepublicThe top 30 produced Items are visualized below:From the Figure below we see that in Food Production, the increase in growth of Food from year
2004 to 2013.When the Year, Country and Item are grouped, the mean of produce item, produced per year is
shown belowSum of Food Produced Item, Values produced per year.
The mean production is shown below:
FOOD SUPPLY
The food supply value is measured in kcal/person/day, with Features of Country, Value, Year.
The trends from 2004 to 2013, all summed for each country had little changes in progressionThe Food Supply Trend Shown in Line Plots
The country with the lowest Food Supply Trend is Zambia While the Country with the highest is
Egypt.The Top Countries supplying food since 2004 to 2013 is shown above, in which it is noticed that
top 4 of those countries comes from Northern Africa Zone.
The above is for Food Production.
Comparing the two plots for Top countries, there are changes in countries that produces food and
countries that supply food. For example, the case in Nigeria. This discrepancy can be due to the
population and most importantly the Food Items, and its Value Kiloton consumed in the country,
where Egypt comes at top, because of the type of food they consume.Egypt has up to 70 unique produce items (in relation to year 2004 to 2013), while Nigeria has 61
unique produced items.
More analysis was undergone for Cassava Products, checking for outliers and also the top
producing countries for Cassava.
Oats Production:Algeria, Ethiopia and South Africa are the top 3 countries that produces Oats.
Rice Production:
Rice Production Top 3 countries are Egypt, Nigeria, Madagascar.

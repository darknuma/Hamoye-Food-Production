The Exploartoray Data Analysis on food production and food supply in Africa

DATA STORYTELLING FOR FOOD PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY IN AFRICA.
The dataset used, related to food production for African Countries from the 2004 to 2013, and also the food supply data for also African Countries from year 2004 to 2013.
The goal was to find trends, and answer certain questions in terms of production, shortages and
supplies for Food Production in the country.
And with that, there was no missing data or duplicated data found in both datasets.
The first thing was to explore the Food Production data.
Food Production:
It featured a number of 4 features, which are the:
1. Country
2. Year
3. Value
4. Item
Later another column was added to show that the Value of each item was measured in the Metric of Kiloton.
The number are 54 countries, and the number of Food produced item is 247 items.

For the Value in Kiloton for all Items, for 54 countries from year 2004 to 2013:
a) The minimum value was 0kt
b) The maximum value was 54000kt
c) The mean value was 327.7kt
In checking for Outliers for Food Production per year we could see that this occurredThen the investigation of the trend For Countries per the Value of Food produced is shown below
This figure above shows at which year, and which the country has the highest Metric Tons in


The top 5 countries with the highest food production:
1. Nigeria
2. Egypt3. South Africa
4. United Republic
5. Ghana

List of Top Produce Food Items
a) Cassava and Products
b) Sugar Cane
c) Maize and Products
d) Yams
e) Vegetables, Other
The Top 5 Countries with the Number of Food Production are:
1. Nigeria
2. Egypt
3. South Africa
4. Ethiopia
5. United Republic


FOOD SUPPLY
The food supply value is measured in kcal/person/day, with Features of Country, Value, Year.
The trends from 2004 to 2013, all summed for each country had little changes in progressionThe Food Supply Trend Shown in Line Plots.
The country with the lowest Food Supply Trend is Zambia While the Country with the highest is Egypt.The Top Countries supplying food since 2004 to 2013 is shown above, in which it is noticed that top 4 of those countries comes from Northern Africa Zone.

Comparing the two plots for Top countries, there are changes in countries that produces food and countries that supply food. For example, the case in Nigeria. This discrepancy can be due to the population and most importantly the Food Items, and its Value Kiloton consumed in the country, where Egypt comes at top, because of the type of food they consume.Egypt has up to 70 unique produce items (in relation to year 2004 to 2013), while Nigeria has 61 unique produced items.
